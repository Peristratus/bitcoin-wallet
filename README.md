## BITQUEST WEBSITE
![Project Image](/img/bqimg.png)
> I want to develop a crypto currency trading and crypto wallet mobile website **for** users who are interested in the crypto market 
> with **the** ability to use AI bots **that** are unique in nature with specific algorithms to trade on behalf of the user and give
> predictive analysis on the next trade to the user, **unlike** any crypto trading platform the AI bot's will be owned by the user(s) and not
> by the web development company, this will make **our product** unique because the AI bot's are look out for the intrests of the user(s) and not
> the web development company.

 ## Description

 The inspiration for developing this website was to start to lay the foundations for a bitcoin/crypto currency wallet and trading platform, this
 is purley educational at this juncture and part of my first project for the Canadian Business college as a full stack developer, i intend to 
 build on this application as my skills evolve throughout my learning process, the website will slowly develop into a fully functional website 
 with the first application "crypto wallet" becoming fully funtional in the coming few months, the second stage devlopment will be a crypto 
 currency platform and the final stage development will be the AI trading bots. These two attributes will be added as my skill become more 
 discerniable, I would also like to collaborate with anyone on github to accomplish these set objectives. I hope to develop this project to 
 become ubiquitous with users around the world.
